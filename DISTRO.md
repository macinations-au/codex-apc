# Distro Plan: Codex APC (Separate Distribution)

This repository is a downstream distribution that tracks upstream `openai/codex` while adding ACP stdio support and extra features the upstream may not ship.

## Strategy

- Source of truth for Codex runtime remains upstream (`codex-core`, etc.). We pin git dependencies and automate bumps.
- ACP agent (`codex-acp`) lives here and can be embedded elsewhere via a small library API.
- We release our own binaries and changelogs. Upstream updates are pulled regularly and tested before release.

## Tracking Upstream

- GitHub Action `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` queries `openai/codex` `main` and opens an automated PR bumping git dependencies to the latest commit.
- A manual helper script `scripts/sync-upstream.sh <sha>` performs the same locally.
- After merging the sync PR, cut a new tag to publish updated binaries.

## Modes

- ACP mode (stdio): provided by this repo (`codex-acp`), intended for IDEs that speak ACP.
- CLI/TUI mode: provided by `codex-agentic` with a vendor-patched TUI. The `/model` picker includes Ollama models; it saves model only (provider is session-only).

## Extras (Downstream Only)

- IDE-friendly status banners and slash commands (`/status`, `/init`, `/model`, `/approvals`, `/thoughts`).
- Reasoning view control in both modes (`--reasoning hidden|summary|raw`); inline `<think>` sections are collapsed when summarized/hidden.
- Custom prompt discovery â†’ auto-exposed as ACP commands.
- Lockstep launcher (`scripts/codex-agentic.sh`) to keep installed binary synced with latest local build.
- CI hardening for Git dependencies, macOS runner selection, reproducible packaging and checksums.

## Future Roadmap

- Optional combined binary offering CLI (vendored from upstream) and ACP (`--acp`), gated behind a feature flag.
- More IDE-only ergonomics (auto-MCP wiring, richer tool call UX) kept downstream to avoid upstream scope creep.
