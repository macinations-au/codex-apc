> This repository is implemented by the `codex` agent.

An Agent Client Protocol (ACP)â€“compatible agent that bridges the OpenAI Codex runtime with ACP clients over stdio. This project is under active development â€” features are evolving and breaking changes are likely.

## Highlights

- Agent Client Protocol (ACP) over stdio using `agent-client-protocol`.
- Integrates with the Codex Rust workspace for conversation management and event streaming.
- Slash commands with ACP AvailableCommands updates (advertised to clients on session start).
- Status output tailored for IDEs (workspace, account, model, token usage).
- Discovers custom prompts via `Op::ListCustomPrompts` and advertises them as commands.

## Requirements

- Rust (Rust 2024 edition; rustc 1.89+ as pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`).
- Network access for building Git dependencies (Codex workspace, ACP crate).

Optional for development:
- To run without Codex backend (for ACP flow testing), set `ACP_DEV_ALLOW_MOCK=1` to enable a mock session that supports slash commands like `/status` but does not call the Codex backend.

## Build

```bash
make build
```

## Run

The agent communicates over stdin/stdout using ACP JSON-RPC. Launch it and connect from an ACP client (e.g., an IDE integration or a CLI client implementing ACP):

```bash
# With tracing logs
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --quiet
```

Because this agent speaks on stdio, it is intended to be spawned by your client. For manual testing, you can pipe ACP JSON-RPC messages to stdin and read replies from stdout.

Example JSON-RPC (initialize â†’ new session â†’ /status):

```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"v1","clientName":"cli","capabilities":{}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"session/new","params":{"cwd":"/absolute/path","mcpServers":[]}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"session/prompt","params":{"sessionId":"1","prompt":[{"type":"text","text":"/status"}]}}
```

## Usage (ACP over stdio)

Minimal smoke test from a shell piping JSON-RPC over stdio:

```bash
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"v1","clientName":"cli","capabilities":{}}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"session/new","params":{"cwd":"'"$PWD"'","mcpServers":[]}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"session/prompt","params":{"sessionId":"1","prompt":[{"type":"text","text":"/status"}]}}' \
| RUST_LOG=info cargo run --quiet
```

Or use the included script and Makefile target:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/stdio-smoke.sh
make smoke
```

### Configuration in [Zed](https://zed.dev)

> Add this configuration to zed settings.
```json
"agent_servers": {
  "Codex": {
    "command": "codex-acp",
    "args": [],
    "env": {
      "RUST_LOG": "info"
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

- ACP Agent implementation
  - Handles `initialize`, `authenticate` (no-op for now), `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`.
  - Streams Codex events (assistant text and deltas, reasoning deltas, token counts) as `session/update` notifications.

- Slash commands (advertised via `AvailableCommandsUpdate`)
  - Implemented today:
    - `/init` - Create an AGENTS.md file with instructions for Codex
    - `/model` â€” Show or set the current model (uses `Op::OverrideTurnContext`).
    - `/approvals` â€” Set approval mode (`untrusted | on-request | on-failure | never`).
    - `/status` â€” Rich status (workspace, account, model, token usage).
    - `/reasoning <hidden|summary|raw>` â€” control whether to show thinking (raw), show concise summaries, or hide it.

- Available commands with custom prompts
  - On new session the agent first advertises built-in commands.
  - It then requests `Op::ListCustomPrompts` from Codex and advertises discovered prompts as additional commands (name + path in description). These are discoverable in client popups that read `available_commands_update`.

## Status Output (`/status`)

The `/status` command prints a human-friendly summary, e.g.:

```
ðŸ“‚ Workspace
  â€¢ Path: ~/path/to/workspace
  â€¢ Approval Mode: on-request
  â€¢ Sandbox: workspace-write
  â€¢ AGENTS files: (none)

ðŸ‘¤ Account
  â€¢ Signed in with ChatGPT (or API key / Not signed in)
  â€¢ Login: user@example.com
  â€¢ Plan: Plus

ðŸ§  Model
  â€¢ Name: gpt-5
  â€¢ Provider: OpenAI
  â€¢ Reasoning Effort: Medium
  â€¢ Reasoning Summaries: Auto

ðŸ“Š Token Usage
  â€¢ Session ID: <uuid>
  â€¢ Input: 0
  â€¢ Output: 0
  â€¢ Total: 0
```

Notes
- Some fields may be unknown depending on your auth mode and environment.
- Token counts are aggregated from Codex `EventMsg::TokenCount` when available.

## Development

- Branching: prefer topic branches; small, focused commits.
- Lint/test locally using `cargo check`, `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test`.
- Logging uses `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber`; use `RUST_LOG=info` during development.

## Library Embedding

You can embed the ACP stdio server into another binary (e.g., `codex-cli`) without hacks. The crate exposes a small API:

```rust
// In your binary crate (e.g., codex-cli)
use codex_acp::{run_stdio_with_config};
use codex_core::config::{Config, ConfigOverrides};

#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // parse flags... if --acp set:
    let cfg = Config::load_with_cli_overrides(vec![], ConfigOverrides::default())?;
    run_stdio_with_config(cfg).await
}
```

Helpers:
- `run_stdio_with_config(config)` â€” async; takes ownership of stdio.
- `run_stdio(overrides, cfg_overrides)` â€” async; loads config then runs.
- `run_stdio_blocking()` â€” sets up a singleâ€‘threaded runtime and runs; convenient from nonâ€‘async mains.

This lets `codex-cli` default to its existing CLI/TUI, and switch to ACP when `--acp` is provided.
